# etch-a-sketch
## Site designed to be an etch-a-sketch clone. Make your own pixel art! 
<br>
Choose your color from the color pallete and your desired grid size. <br>
The grid size determines how many simulated "pixels" the etch-a-sketch area will have. The acutal area will not get larger or smaller, but a higher grid size means more pixels and more detailed art!
<br><br>
A live preview can be viewed [here](https://jbfink97.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)
